#### Install latest version of Terraform on macOS

To install the latest version of Terraform on macOS, you can use Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. Here are the steps:

1. Open Terminal.

2. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Terraform by running the following command:

```bash
brew install terraform
```

4. After the installation is complete, verify the installation by checking the Terraform version:

```bash
terraform version
```

This should display the version of Terraform that was installed.
