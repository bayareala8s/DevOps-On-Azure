### Terraform script to create Azure AI Computer Vision services in US West region

To create Azure AI Computer Vision services in the US West region using Terraform, you need to use the `azurerm_cognitive_account` resource. Here's an example:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "myResourceGroup"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurerm_cognitive_account" "account" {
  name                = "example-account"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  kind                = "ComputerVision"
  sku_name            = "S1"

  tags = {
    environment = "production"
  }
}
```

This script does the following:

- Configures the Azure provider.
- Creates a resource group in the West US region.
- Creates a Cognitive Services account in the same region as the resource group. The kind of the account is set to "ComputerVision", which means that it's an account for the Computer Vision service. The SKU of the account is set to "S1", which is a standard tier.

Please replace `"myResourceGroup"` and `"example-account"` with your desired resource group and account names, respectively.

Before you run this script, make sure to authenticate with Azure. You can do this by setting the `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `ARM_TENANT_ID` environment variables to your Azure subscription ID, client ID, client secret, and tenant ID, respectively.

You can then initialize Terraform and apply the script:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

These commands will download the necessary provider plugins and create the resources defined in the script.
