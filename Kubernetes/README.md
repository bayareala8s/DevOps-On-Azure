### High-Level Architecture Diagram for CI/CD for AKS apps with Azure Pipelines

Here's a high-level architecture diagram for a CI/CD pipeline for AKS applications using Azure Pipelines:

```

|                |     |                |     |                |     |                |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
       |                      |                      |                      |
       |                      |                      |                      |
       v                      v                      v                      v
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
|                |     |                |     |                |     |                |
|   Git (VCS)    |     |   Build & Test |     |   Docker Image |     |   Kubernetes   |
|                |     |                |     |   Repository   |     |   Services     |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
```

1. **Developer's Local System**: Developers write code on their local systems. They use Git for version control.

2. **Azure Repo (Source Code)**: The code is pushed to a repository in Azure Repo. This triggers the CI/CD pipeline in Azure Pipelines.

3. **Azure Pipelines (CI/CD Tool)**: Azure Pipelines pulls the latest code from Azure Repo. It then builds the Docker image, runs tests, and pushes the Docker image to a Docker image repository.

4. **AKS Cluster (Deployed App)**: Azure Pipelines deploys the Docker image to an AKS cluster. The application is now running in a Kubernetes service in the AKS cluster.

The arrows represent the flow of code and artifacts through the pipeline:

- Code flows from the developer's local system to Azure Repo.
- Azure Pipelines pulls the code from Azure Repo, builds and tests the code, and pushes the Docker image to a Docker image repository.
- Azure Pipelines deploys the Docker image from the Docker image repository to the AKS cluster.

This is a high-level overview and the actual implementation may vary based on specific requirements.
